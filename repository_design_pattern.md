# Repository Design Pattern
- A repository design pattern provides a layer of abstraction between the data access layer and business logic layer of an application.
- Encapsulated code that interacts with the data source, such as database. This makes it easier to change the data source without changing the rest of the application.
- A mock database can be used to simulate the behaviour of a real database, without actually storing any data. These can be useful during development and testing.
